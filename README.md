> Given a dataset create an svm model to predict whether an asteroid is hazardous or not


Given a [dataset](https://github.com/Anant5Gokhale/iosd_ml_task/blob/main/neo.csv), the aim is to implement a SVM model and provide a comparative study using different kernels(linear, polynomial, gaussian, sigmoid, RBF etc) using precision and f1-scores.
The SVM model used here is for classifying data as hazardous or non-hazardous.
Unlike the traditional statistical approach, SVMs takes a geometric approach to build a classifier.
SVMs use algorithms that facilitate making of large margin classifiers. Graphically this gives 'well-partioned' positive and negative data points.
